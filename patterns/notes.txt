What is Design PAtterns? 
    -Its a typical solutions to common proplems in software design
    -Each pattern works like pre-made blueprint
    -Pattern is not a spesific piece of code but a general solution
    -Its not an algorithm because they are set of actions to achive some goals
    -Pattern is high level description
    -Ex. code of same pattern in two application can be different
    -Algorithm => spesic Pattern => general 

Why should you learn Patterns ? 
    -You can manage your code without patterns but propably you used some of them before unconciously
    -They are toolkit of tried and tested solutions for common problems

Classification
    -Patterns are different from eachother with complexity 
    -We call high-level patterns architectural
1-Creational Patterns
    -Those patterns provides various object creation mechanizm, which increase flexibilty and creation of reusable code. 
2-Structural Patterns   
    -These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
3-Behavioral Patterns
    -These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
