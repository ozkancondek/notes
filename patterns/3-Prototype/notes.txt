-Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.
-The implementation of the clone method is very similar in all classes. 
-The method creates an object of the current class and carries over all of the field values of the old object into the new one. 
-An object that supports cloning is called a prototype.
-Main reason is cost of object production.
-We can also say creating a new object from existing object. 
-We not using new instance because we not creating a new object. We cloning a object.
-Thats why the only problem we could say reducing memory costs.
